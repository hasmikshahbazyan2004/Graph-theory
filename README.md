ðŸ“˜ Graph Theory

Welcome to the Graph Theory repository â€” a personal project dedicated to implementing core graph data structures, algorithms, and selected LeetCode problems. This project demonstrates my understanding of graph theory concepts, algorithm design, and mathematical thinking.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project was created as part of my application to the American University of Armenia (AUA) to showcase:

My knowledge of mathematics, particularly graph theory

My ability to implement complex data structures and algorithms

My interest in solving real-world computational problems using graphs

ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Included

âœ… Graph Implementations

Adjacency List

Adjacency Matrix

Weighted/Unweighted Graphs

Directed/Undirected Graphs

âœ… Core Algorithms

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm

Primâ€™s Algorithm

Topological Sort

Cycle Detection

Connected Components

Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)

âœ… LeetCode Problems

Solutions to graph-based LeetCode problems with explanations

Focus on problems demonstrating theoretical and practical understanding

ðŸ§  Learning Goals

Strengthen my understanding of discrete mathematics and algorithm design

Practice implementing complex logic from scratch in C++

Prepare for future university-level courses in CS and Math

Improve problem-solving through competitive programming
